For the avoidance of doubt Licensor shall be liable in accordance with the German Product Liability Act in the event of product liability. The foregoing applies also to Licensor’s legal representatives or assistants in performance. Any further liability shall be excluded.
Patent claims generated through the usage of the Model & Software cannot be directed towards the copyright holders.
The Model & Software is provided in the state of development the licensor defines. If modified or extended by Licensee, the Licensor makes no claims about the fitness of the Model & Software and is not responsible for any problems such modifications cause.

No Maintenance Services
You understand and agree that Licensor is under no obligation to provide either maintenance services, update services, notices of latent defects, or corrections of defects with regard to the Model & Software.
