## Description

This repository contains the fitting code used for the experiments in [Expressive Body Capture: 3D Hands, Face, and Body from a Single Image](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/).

### Fitting 
Run the following command to execute the code:
```Shell
python smplifyx/main.py --config cfg_files/fit_smplx.yaml 
    --data_folder DATA_FOLDER 
    --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER 
    --visualize="True/False"
    --model_folder MODEL_FOLDER
    --vposer_ckpt VPOSER_FOLDER
    --part_segm_fn smplx_parts_segm.pkl
```

```
python smplifyx/main.py --config cfg_files/fit_smplx.yaml --data_folder DATA_FOLDER --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER --visualize=True --model_folder models --vposer_ckpt VPOSER_FOLDER --part_segm_fn smplx_parts_segm.pkl
```

where the `DATA_FOLDER` should contain two subfolders, `images`, where the
images are located, and `keypoints`, where the OpenPose output should be
stored.

### Different Body Models

To fit [SMPL](http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) or [SMPL+H](http://mano.is.tue.mpg.de), replace the *yaml* configuration file 
with either *fit_smpl.yaml* or *fit_smplx.yaml*, i.e.:
 * for SMPL:
 ```Shell
 python smplifyx/main.py --config cfg_files/fit_smpl.yaml 
    --data_folder DATA_FOLDER 
    --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER 
    --visualize="True/False"
    --model_folder MODEL_FOLDER
    --vposer_ckpt VPOSER_FOLDER
 ```
  * for SMPL+H:
 ```Shell
 python smplifyx/main.py --config cfg_files/fit_smplh.yaml 
    --data_folder DATA_FOLDER 
    --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER 
    --visualize="True/False"
    --model_folder MODEL_FOLDER
    --vposer_ckpt VPOSER_FOLDER
 ```
 
### Visualizing Results

To visualize the results produced by the method you can run the following script:
```Shell
python smplifyx/render_results.py --mesh_fns OUTPUT_MESH_FOLDER
```
where *OUTPUT_MESH_FOLDER* is the folder that contains the resulting meshes.

## Dependencies

Follow the installation instructions for each of the following before using the
fitting code.

1. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
2. [SMPL-X](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx)
3. [VPoser](https://github.com/nghorbani/HumanBodyPrior)
4. [Homogenus](https://github.com/nghorbani/homogenus)

### Optional Dependencies

1. [PyTorch Mesh self-intersection](https://github.com/vchoutas/torch-mesh-isect) for interpenetration penalty 
   * Download the per-triangle part segmentation: [smplx_parts_segm.pkl](https://owncloud.tuebingen.mpg.de/index.php/s/MWnr8Kso4K8T8at)
1. [Trimesh](https://trimsh.org/) for loading triangular meshes
1. [Pyrender](https://pyrender.readthedocs.io/) for visualization

The code has been tested with Python 3.6, CUDA 10.0, CuDNN 7.3 and PyTorch 1.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.
